## DuckDB.close() method

Closes the underlying duckdb database, frees associated memory and renders it unusuable.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
close(): void;
```

<b>Returns:</b>

void

## Remarks

Even though GC will automatically destroy the Connection object at some point, DuckDB data is stored in the native address space, not the V8 heap, meaning you can easily have a Node.js process taking gigabytes of memory (more than the default heap size for Node.js) with V8 not triggering GC. So, definitely think about manually calling `close()`<!-- -->.
