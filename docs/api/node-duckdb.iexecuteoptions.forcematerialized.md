## IExecuteOptions.forceMaterialized property

Materialized means that the whole result is loaded into memory, as opposed to streaming which means there is a pointer to the next row and rows are retrieved one by one. If falsy, DuckDB will \*attempt\* to not load the whole result set into memory at once.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
forceMaterialized?: boolean;
```
